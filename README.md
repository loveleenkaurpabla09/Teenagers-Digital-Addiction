The Project involves a Rule Based Approach to Identify Teenagers Physiological Orientation to be a Cyberbullying Victim or Offender. The main aim of the proposed work is to perform an experimental   investigation on teenagers for discovering the valuable insights from the data.
The Project work can be acceptable for schools for improving the student’s ability by supporting them during the cyberbullying phases.
We have used decision tree algorithm in our project and during training, the tree structure has been prepared by the algorithm using the input training samples.
So, the decision rules generated may help the parents, guardians and teachers to understand whether someone is facing cyberbullying or misbehaving online with others, in order to support the students in early stages and this can be done by simply analyzing very less number of attributes and very few questions says 1 or 2. The Project work can play a crucial role for schools in improving the student’s ability by supporting them during the cyberbullying phases.
